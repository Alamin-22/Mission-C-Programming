A **2-dimensional array** in **C** is essentially an array of arrays. It allows you to store data in a **table-like structure**, where you have rows and columns.

### ðŸ“Œ Definition:
```c
data_type array_name[rows][columns];
```

### âœ… Example:
```c
int matrix[3][4]; // A 3x4 matrix (3 rows, 4 columns)
```
This can be visualized like:
```
[ [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0] ]
```

You can access individual elements using:
```c
matrix[0][2] = 5;  // Sets the element in 1st row, 3rd column to 5
```

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose in Real World:
2D arrays are useful in many **real-world applications**, especially where data is structured like a grid or table:

#### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Matrix Calculations**
- Used in scientific computing, graphics, and physics simulations.
- Example: Matrix multiplication, transformations in 3D graphics.

#### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Games**
- Used to build game boards (like chess, tic-tac-toe, sudoku).
- Example: `char gameBoard[3][3];`

#### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Image Processing**
- An image is made up of pixels arranged in rows and columns.
- Each pixel can be stored as an element in a 2D array.

#### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Storing Tabular Data**
- Like a spreadsheet: rows and columns of data.
- Example: Storing marks of students across subjects.

#### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Pathfinding Algorithms**
- In robotics or games, grids (2D arrays) are used to map out environments and find shortest paths.
